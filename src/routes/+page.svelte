        <h2>My Time at College</h2>
        <p>
            For my further education, I attended Solihull College. Whilst there, I was a Student Rep and a Wellbeing Ambassador. My course ran for 2 years, spanning 18 units and 43 assignments. Additionally, I am proud to mention that I was awarded the Outstanding Student award at the end of both years. I finished my coursework in April 2023 with a forecasted grade of D*D*D*, the highest possible grade.
